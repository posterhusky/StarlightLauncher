# StarlightLauncher

**StarlightLauncher** is a launcher application designed to simplify the management of multiple Fortnite accounts. You can link all of your accounts once and start Fortnite from any of them without needing to re-login.

## üåü Features

* **One-click launch** of Fortnite from any linked account at any time
* **Epic Account Linking** flow (device-code OAuth + auto-refresh)
* **Save/Load** account credentials to skip repeated sign-in
* **Auto-update** via GitHub Releases
* **Multi-language support** (English, Fran√ßais, –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π, Deutsch, Espa√±ol)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config
For now there is no way to change the settings in the launcher itself, all files are stored in the `.../AppData/Roaming/StarlightLauncher/` folder. You can edit the `config.json` file to change settings and upload a `background.png` to set a custom background.
